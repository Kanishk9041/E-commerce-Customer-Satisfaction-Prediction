# Customer Satisfaction Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes customer satisfaction data using Python to identify key factors affecting customer experiences. The analysis involves data preprocessing, sentiment analysis, and visualization to derive meaningful insights.

## 📊 Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, duplicate entries, and data formatting.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Statistical summaries, trends, and correlation analysis.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Identifying positive, neutral, and negative feedback.
- **Visualization**: Customer satisfaction trends over time, demographic insights, and sentiment distribution.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Using machine learning to predict satisfaction levels.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries Used**:
  - Pandas (Data manipulation)
  - NumPy (Numerical analysis)
  - Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data visualization)
  - Plotly (Interactive charts)
  - Scikit-learn (Machine learning models)
  - NLTK & TextBlob (Sentiment analysis)

## 📂 Dataset
- The dataset contains customer feedback records including:
  - Date & Time of feedback
  - Customer ratings
  - Review text
  - Product/service category
  - Customer demographics (if available)

## 📈 Analysis & Insights
1. **Customer Satisfaction Trends**: Identifying changes over time.
2. **Key Drivers of Satisfaction**: Most common positive and negative aspects.
3. **Demographic Breakdown**: How satisfaction varies across customer groups.
4. **Sentiment Distribution**: Proportion of positive, neutral, and negative feedback.
5. **Predictive Modeling**: Forecasting customer satisfaction based on historical data.

## 🚀 Getting Started
### Prerequisites
